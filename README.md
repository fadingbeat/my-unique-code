#first project

This was a first time HTML/CSS project as an assigment for a job application. The assigment was to create a page with photographs and make them open 
in modal window. This had to be done in two days. 
What you see is what I have done in two days, there are slight differences which I will add later, when I learn how to make second commit. 

I started from scratch with another project which is visible in second repository.
